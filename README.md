A lightweight and secure library for easily sending emails using Gmail SMTP servers and a Gmail/GSuite Account. This package does not use Nodemailer but uses Google APIs. It simplifies the mammoth task of dealing with OAuth2 and does it in a secure manner. Useful for building servers with mailing features.
